# Rhyme Sorter

### An Exercise in Ruby

Your goal is to:

- read the words from the file `words.txt`
- sort the words according to which ones rhyme together (start with just visual rhymes)
- output the sorted list of rhyming words

The final output should look like this:

```
angel
bagel
birthday
blow
snow
boat
goat
bowl
candle
chapter
computer
euler
winter
feet
orange
screen
sheep
yogurt
```

You get extra points if your algorithm groups angel, bagel, and candle together.
